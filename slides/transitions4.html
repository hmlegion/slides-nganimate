<h2>Timing Functions</h2>
<p>And then there's timing functions, which describe how the animation slides or "eases" into it's beginning and end points.</p>
<pre class="code-left"><code>
transition-timing-function: linear
transition-timing-function: ease
transition-timing-function: ease-in
transition-timing-function: ease-out
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out
</code></pre>
<div class="link-wrap timing-functions">
