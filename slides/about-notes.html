<ul>
	<li>I was a Designery CSS guy, so I look for CSS solutions rather than JS ones. Not suggesting this is the best answer. </li>
	<li class="fragment">There are many ways to skin a cat. Yours may be better. </li>
	<li class="fragment">Few browsers still need prefixes, but JS/Precompilers can ease this problem.</li>
	<li class="fragment">Many of the code examples here are formatted for slide readability, and prefix free.</li>
